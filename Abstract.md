Title: BlessThee – Giving Back

BlessThee is a platform that makes several types of donations easier, convenient and more effective. It comprises of sections for different type of donations which can then be accessed by NGOs and other groups dedicated to social work.

It comprises of four sections explained below:
1)	Food Donation: 
      i)   The leftover eatable food from licensed restaurants,   shops, industrial and commercial kitchens will be collected on a daily basis through registrations. 
     ii)  The occasional events such as weddings, bhandaras and big parties can also register for the donation.
     iii)  Groceries can be donated by everyone.

2)    Clothes Donation: 
       As we all have clothes that are not in use and are just occupying space which better be donated and can be a lot of help to someone in need of them. The users can input the amount of clothes to be donated and their address which will be collected into a database and ready for mass pick up by NGOs and partnering communities.


3)	Academic Donation: 
        Bags, stationeries and Books which are better to be distributed among children those who actually need them rather than selling it to raddiwala.

People don’t know how to or where to donate. They have no platform or systematic process which makes the task easier and tells them what to donate and to whom. NGOs mostly do field work but that field work needs technical support which will be provided by this platform.

It will be a web based application developed using, HTML, object-oriented language Java, JavaScript and an Access database, employing MYSQL Relational Database Management System and a JDBC driver as a software component that will enable the application to interact with the database.
